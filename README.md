How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the
dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  The process that I try to approach develping maintainable, readable, and adapatable code is to develop it in sections, comment on the sections to show what they are
acomplishing, and keep good spacing between the sections. This allows for the developer or any colaborators to be able to see a chunk know what that section is doing and be able
to add or subtract from that section to fit the development. This shows the best in the CRUD project where the create, read, update, and delete sections are all seperate functions
from eachother and has comments on what each line adds to the code. I think spacing is really important to seperate functions and makes it more readable to the eye. The advantages
of working this way is being able to read through section of the code and portion out the work, this will allow for easier testing of the code and the ability to find something you
may need to change later. Luckilly the CRUD module that was created is very flexible but it is currently tied to one login on the one database but it can be changed to fit a
different login elsewhere. The code itself can be used anywhere that may need a CRUD operation within it. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach 
to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  For me a checklist has always shown me the best way to solving any problem that I have in and outside of coding. I will always start with the easiest solution to the hardest
when trying to fix something. To diagnose a problem I will find the core of the problem first, an example would be diagnosing a car, I had an issue with my car that could have
been multiple things to find the issue I ran through a few steps of what it could be then chose the chepest solution to that issue and worked my way to the more expensive. The
approach I had with the requirements for this project was not to different from others, I seen the list of requirements and followed down that list to create the dashboard.
The biggest difference was the way I approached issues that I had, I had not worked with Python in almost a year in a previous class and I was very rusty so I followed the
readings more closely when it came to this project and I have never worked in MongoDB so there was a lot of reading on the Mongo website. I think that the most important part
of this course was the use of MongoDB and the techniques used in MongoDB will always be important throughout my career; I was getting overwhelmed with the creation of the 
database in this course and I think a stratagy that I will continue with is to take it day by day and do what I know how to do, this will reduce the pressure and drowning
feeling in the future. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists have a very important role in the world especially in todays age with all of the technology and how many people use it. Computer science covers all of what
may be used within this space from a database to security. This role is important to make sure that workers can use their systems properly, or the government can keep their
information protected properly this matters to everyone to be able to do their jobs, have fun, stay safe, or even go through there day to day life. The work that was done in this
project is important to a company to be able to manage their properties or their information. The project we did was a database for incoming, outgoing, or current animals in there
shelter. The database allows them to better their work by having an easy to work and acess database with all of the animals information in one place.
